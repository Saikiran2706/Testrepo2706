Once we install git , we need to initialize git using the command
-> git init

command to list the files
-> ls 
 > ls-l ( to check the permissions and the files in the directory)
 > ls -a ( to check the hidden files in the directory)
 
To check the status of git
 > git status
 
To create a file in git
 > touch filename ( touch abc)
 
To create multiple files
 > touch file1 file2 file3 ( have to enter the file names with a space )
 
To enter the content in the file
 >vim filename ( vim abc ) or cat >> filename (cat >> abc)
 we can enter the content by clicking shift+i that moves to insert mode in git , once done with the completion of the content we can press esc :wq which saves and exits the file )

To view the content of the file
> cat filename (cat abc ) { but this doesn't display the existing content in the file }

Once we enter the content in the file we need to save using ctrl+D

-Once we create a file and give the content it will be in the workspace
-We need to use git add filename then it moves to stagin/index area
  If we have to move multiple files to staging area we need to use git add . or git add *
- Once we move to stagin/index area we need to commit to local repository using the cmd git commit -m "lable"
   Lable - why we need to commit or why the modification is needed any comment we can add
- Once done with the modification and ready to push to central repository we need to use git push
 
Before git push ,
we need to create an account in github and have to create a repository and have to click the code option and copy the URL generated by git
And use the command git clone and the url ( git clone URL ) then we are good to push the files to cloud

If wanted to move from local to staging area ( this should be performed with n-1 formulae , should be performed with not the latest commit id , should be the performed with one before the latest commitid)
-git reset --soft cid (commit id ) -> to check the commit id we need to use the cmd git log
If wanted to move from staging to workspace
-git reset HEAD filename
If wanted to move from local to workspace
-git reset --mixed cid


Branching concept 
 
- Using the master content we can create a branch and can make updates in the branch

To create a new branch - git branch branchname

To check what all branches created  - git branch

To switch from 1 branch to other - git checkout branchname

Note : Once we make changes in branch files we need to commit then ,
      if not the files will be replicated , even if we delete the files
	  without commit in branch , the files in master will also be deleted.
	  
	  
If we wanted to merge the branch to the master branch we need to use
 - git merge branchname
 ( should be performed only in master branch) 
 
- To check what all braches merged with master
  git branch --merged
-To check what all branches not merged with master
  git branch --no-merged
